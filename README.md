# liri-node-app

This application is built with jQuery with npm Request, Moment, DotEnv, Node-Spotify-API, OMDB API, and Bands in Town API. 

* _Remember to do 'npm install' in your command line to play around with this application_

**Here is the Demo:**

#### Reflection
I personally like to play around with APIs and so I really enjoy the process building this application. The only advice I have for myself is that this application can be more user-friendly even without the demo videos above. There are still a lot of room for improvement for this application. :+1:
